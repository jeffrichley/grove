Claude Code was made generally available
 May 22nd of last year along with the
 release of Claude 4, but there was also
 a research preview before this and so
 I've been using the tool for a bit over
 a year now and I actually did the math.
 If you count all the time it took for me
 to prompt claude, review the code,
 monitor it. I have used the tool for
 over 2,000 hours now. So yeah, I have a
 thing or two to teach you. That's what I
 want to do in this video. So, right now,
 I want to share with you all of my
 battle tested strategies that will take
 you from a basic Cloud Code user all the
 way to a power user. I've bundled
 everything up together into what I call
 the Whisk framework. And here's the
 thing, these strategies are legit. I am
 not one of those AI content creators
 that has just jumped on the Cloud Code
 bandwagon the past few months. I've been
 using this tool, like I said, daily for
 over a year now. And so these strategies
 are going to work on any codebase, even
 massive ones, even projects that have
 multiple code bases. I've seen all of
 this applied at an enterprise level. And
 so no matter what you're working on,
 this is for you. This also really works
 for any AI coding assistant. I'm just
 focused on cloud code because it is the
 best right now. And so I am assuming
 here that you have at least a basic
 understanding of cloud code and now you
 want to take things to the next level.
 If you want the basics of building a
 system for AI coding, I'll have a video
 that I'll link to right here. All of
 these strategies, this is when we want
 to work on real code bases that get
 messy because we have a bunch of
 strategies here around context
 management. This is important because
 context rot is the biggest problem with
 AI coding assistance right now. It
 doesn't matter that we have the new 1
 million token limit for clawed code. We
 still need to treat our context as the
 most precious resource that has to be
 engineered very carefully with our AI
 coding assistants. And so the WIS and C
 for the framework, all these strategies
 apply to that. And these are all things
 that you can take and apply to your
 projects immediately. So I'm going to
 break it down nice and simple for you
 here. Now the question you might be
 asking yourself is, Cole, why are we
 focusing so much on context management?
 Over 2,000 hours of using cloud code.
 this is what you want to focus on. And
 my answer is yes. I know this is very
 specific, but we need to lean right now
 into context rot and how to avoid this.
 I would go so far as to say that about
 80% of the time when your coding agent
 messes up in your codebase, it's because
 you aren't managing your context well
 enough. And so I want to start with the
 problem of context rot and then we'll
 very quickly get practical diving into
 every part of the whisk framework. But I
 want to start with context rot as a
 precursor so you can really see why once
 you apply the whisk framework you're
 going to immediately see jumps in
 reliability with your AI coding even on
 messier code bases and I keep
 emphasizing larger messier code bases
 because that's where we see context rot
 becoming more and more of a problem.
 Now, there has been a lot of research in
 the industry on context rod, but my
 favorite, this is the most practical and
 probably most popular as well, is the
 Chroma technical report covering how
 increasing input tokens impacts LLM
 performance. And the main idea here is
 just because you can fit a certain
 amount of tokens into an LLM's context
 window doesn't mean that you should. And
 yes, it supplies the cloud code with the
 new 1 million token limit as well
 because large language models get
 overwhelmed with information just like
 people do. It is called the needle in
 the haystack problem. So when you have a
 very specific piece of information or
 with coding agents a specific file that
 it's read that you need it to recall, it
 will do a good job recalling that
 information in its short-term memory,
 but only if you don't have a superfilled
 context window. When you start to have a
 massive amount of contacts loaded, you
 start to get what are called
 distractors. And so these are pieces of
 information that are close or similar to
 what you need the LLM to recall, but not
 quite right. And we see this a lot with
 AI coding, especially with larger code
 bases. We are following the same
 patterns for things throughout our
 codebase. We have a lot of similarity in
 how different parts of our codebase are
 implemented. And so large language
 models will pull the wrong information
 and be very confident about their fix or
 implementation. I'm sure you've seen
 this all of the time. We have this
 needle in the haststack problem applying
 all of the time to AI coding. This is
 the idea of context rot. The larger our
 window gets, the more the large language
 model has a hard time pulling out
 exactly what we need for the current
 turn with our coding agent. So going
 back to the diagram, let me get super
 specific for you. What we're addressing
 with all of these strategies is the
 question, how do we keep our context
 window as lean as possible while still
 giving the coding agent all of the
 context it needs? That is the context
 engineering that we are doing here. And
 so I'm going to go through every single
 strategy. And I even have an example for
 each of them that I'll go through live
 with you on a complicated codebase. And
 all the commands and rules and docs that
 I use as an example, I have in this
 folder that I'll link to in the
 description. So you can use all of these
 strategies conceptually but also with
 these commands as an example that I have
 in the dotcloud folder right here. All
 right. So let's get into the individual
 strategies now. So W stands for write, I
 for isolate, S for select and C for
 compress. And of course we will start
 with the W here, which is writing,
 externalizing our agents memory as much
 as possible. We want to capture key
 decisions and what the agent has been
 working on so that in future sessions we
 can catch our agent up to speed a lot
 faster and have to spend less tokens up
 front having the agent understand what
 we really needed to do. And so the first
 strategy here is to use the git log as
 long-term memory. And I absolutely love
 this because there are so many people
 that love to overengineer and have super
 complicated memory frameworks for their
 coding agents, but really everyone's
 already using Git and GitHub for version
 control. And so we can take advantage of
 a tool that we're already using to
 provide long-term memory to our agent.
 Let's go into our codebase and I'll show
 you what I mean. So the codebase I'm
 going to be using for all the examples
 here is the new archon. And I've been
 working my butt off on this the last few
 months behind the scenes. This is your
 AI command center where you can create,
 manage, and execute longer running AI
 coding workflows. And we're even working
 on a workflow builder. It's going to be
 like the N8 for AI coding. And so we can
 kick off workflows. We can view the logs
 and monitor them in our mission control.
 We can look at past runs to see exactly
 what happened. Like this is a a very
 long workflow that I have to validate
 entire pull requests in my codebase. So
 yeah, you can tell from looking at this
 and a lot more in Archon coming soon, by
 the way. Okay, but you can tell from
 looking at this that there are a lot of
 moving parts. This is a very complicated
 codebase. So, it makes for a good
 example for everything I'm going to
 cover with you here, all of the
 strategies. And so, going to get as
 long-term memory, I'll show you an
 example right here of a oneliner for all
 of my recent commit messages. And what I
 want to point out here is that we have a
 very standard way of creating these
 commit messages. So, we have our merges,
 but we also have all these feature
 implementations and fixes. And so I have
 things very standard because that way I
 can rely on the commit messages to tell
 my coding agent what I've worked on
 recently because a lot of the time that
 will guide us for what we want to work
 on next. And the reason I have this so
 standard is because there is a commit
 command that I run. Now running a git
 commit is very easy. But if we want to
 standardize the message and have the
 coding agent help us with that having a
 specific command is very powerful. So I
 have this full implementation that I did
 here in a single context window with the
 coding agent. I'm at the end now where
 I'm ready to run my commit. And so if I
 just run / commit. That's all I have to
 do. It's running this command that has
 the standardization for how I document
 any work that I did and then also
 anything I did to improve my rules or
 command. So it's a twopart command.
 Here's what we built. Here's how we
 improve the AI layer. And so it's going
 to make this commit and I'll show you
 what it looks like after. All right. All
 right. So now looking at our commit
 message, we can see that we made some
 test improvements to the CLI. So a
 really nice prefix then getting into the
 details and then also so the coding
 agent knows how its own rules and
 commands are evolving over time. We
 include that in the commit message
 whenever we find an opportunity to
 improve let's say our plan command for
 example. And of course this commit
 command is one of the resources that I
 have for you in the repository if you
 want to use this as a starting point.
 But I also encourage you to customize
 what your commit messages look like. The
 important thing here is we standardize
 the messages. We make them very detailed
 so we can use it as long-term memory.
 All right. So the second right strategy
 is to always start a brand new context
 window whenever you are writing any
 code. No matter what I'm working on, my
 workflow is always I have one
 conversation to plan with the coding
 agent. I'll create some kind of markdown
 that has my structured plan and then I
 will send that in as the only context to
 a new session going into the
 implementation. And so it's very
 important here that your spec has all of
 the context the agent needs to write the
 code and do the validation. So for
 example in this conversation I am just
 doing planning. So I run my prime to
 start. I'll talk about this in a little
 bit. I load in context and then I create
 my plan with this command. So it's
 another one that I have as the resource
 for you. This essentially walks through
 for the coding agent. Here's the exact
 structure that we want to create for our
 single markdown document. So going from
 our short-term memory into a single
 document. And then we end the session
 here. We go to a brand new context
 window and we go with our
 implementation. So I have my execute
 command and then this is where I can
 specify the path to my structure plan.
 No other context because this should
 have everything that it needs. This is
 very important because it keeps our
 coding agent extremely focused on the
 task at hand. There can be a lot of
 research and other things that just
 muddles the context window if we
 implement in the same place that we
 plan. So, the last W strategy that I
 have for externalizing agent memory is
 progress files and decision logs. You'll
 see this all the time with more
 elaborate AI coding frameworks where you
 have like a handoff.md or a to-do.md
 communicating between different sub
 aents or agent teams, even just between
 different agent sessions when you're
 running low on context. A lot of times
 you want to create this summary of what
 was just done so you can go to a fresh
 session because you're starting to see
 that context rot with the agent
 hallucinating as you have these longer
 conversations. Now, obviously it's ideal
 to just avoid these longer
 conversations, but sometimes you need to
 have them. For example, something I do
 with Archon a lot is I'll have it use
 the Verscell agent browser CLI to
 perform endto-end testing within the
 browser. And so I have it go through a
 bunch of different user journeys and
 testing edge cases. It takes a lot of
 context. You can see at the bottom here,
 I ran a slashcontext and we're already
 at 200,000 out of the new 1 million
 limit. This fills up so quickly. And
 once you start to have a few hundred,000
 tokens in the context window, that's
 when you see the performance start to
 degrade for the agent. So, I can simply
 run a slash handoff. This command is
 going to create a summary that I can now
 pass into another session. So that agent
 can continue the work, but now it
 doesn't have hundreds of thousands of
 tokens of tool calls and things like
 that sitting in its window. And this
 handoff command is really just walking
 through a process of here's exactly what
 we want to put in this document so the
 next agent has what it needs. All right,
 so that wraps up our W. And each one of
 these strategies is very important
 because we are logging key decisions for
 future agent sessions to quickly pick up
 on. And I know I'm going quick here, so
 let me know in the comments if there's
 any one of these strategies that you
 want me to make an entire video on
 because I definitely could for each of
 these. And so now we get into the I for
 isolate using sub agents. I love using
 sub aents for all things research, using
 them pretty much every single session.
 The important thing here is keeping your
 main context clean. We can use sub aents
 to perform tens or even hundreds of
 thousands of tokens of research across
 our codebase or the web and then just
 giving the needed summary to our main
 claude code context window. So instead
 of loading in tens of thousands of
 tokens of research into our main context
 window, it is now only something like
 500 tokens. So we still get the core
 information that we need, but we have a
 90.2% 2% improvement according to some
 enthropic research using sub agents to
 load in context upfront for our research
 instead of having our main agent taking
 care of everything. So let me give you
 an example of this really quick. It's
 always at the start of the conversation
 or before that structure plan I covered
 earlier like I'm in the planning process
 that is when I use sub agents very
 heavily. Watch this. I want to build a
 workflow builder into Archon. So I want
 you to spin up two sub agents. one to do
 extensive research in the codebase to
 see how we would build in a workflow
 builder and what that means for archon
 and then spin up another sub agent to do
 web research on best practices for the
 text stack like if I want to use react
 what library should we use and generally
 how do we build workflow builders like
 diffy or nadn
 so I'm just using my texttospech tool
 here send off the prompt there we go and
 so not only do we get the benefit of
 isolation but also speed because it's
 going to use these sub aents in parallel
 come back with the summary and then my
 main agent will synthesize all that and
 give me the final say. So there we go.
 Both of the sub aents are running in
 parallel behind the scenes. We can go
 and view the logs for each of them as
 well. And then it'll come back at the
 end once they're done with the final
 report. All right, our sub agents
 finished and instead of using hundreds
 of thousands of tokens in our main
 context window, which that is how much
 the sub agents did with their research,
 we only used 44,000 tokens, only 4% of
 our window so far. That is the power of
 sub aents. I don't recommend them for
 implementation because usually you want
 all the context of what you did, but for
 research it is very powerful. So yeah,
 isolation and sub aents are very
 important for your planning process. The
 other way that we can use sub agents is
 with what I like to call the scout
 pattern. We want to send scouts ahead
 before you commit your main context.
 There might be parts of your codebase or
 documentation that you want sub agents
 to explore to see if it is relevant to
 load into your main cloud code session.
 So it can kind of make the decision
 ahead of time like yes, we should bring
 this in for our larger planning or no,
 we should skip it. It isn't relevant.
 For example, with archon, I have a few
 markdown documents that are very deep
 dives into certain parts of the
 codebase. Not the kind of context we
 want in our rules because we don't need
 it all the time, but sometimes we might
 want to load this. And you can imagine
 this being something in Confluence or
 Google Drive like wherever you store
 your context. And so going back to this
 main conversation, I can just say spin
 up a sub agent to research everything in
 my do.cloud/docs.
 Are there any pieces of documentation
 here that we would care about loading
 into our main context for planning and I
 can send this in. It'll make the
 decision and then load in what I care
 about. So right here we kicked off an
 explore sub agent. It found all of our
 documentation recommended loading one
 and then I said, "Yep, go ahead and load
 it." This is really important for what
 we're planning here. So instead of just
 doing sub agents for research, sometimes
 we have entire pieces of documentation
 that we think are crucial for our main
 context window. That's we want to use
 the scouting pattern. So that is
 everything for isolation. Remember to
 use sub agents for your research and
 planning very extensively. And now that
 brings us into the S4 select. Load your
 context just in time, not just in case.
 And what I mean by that is if you're not
 100% confident that a piece of
 information is important to your coding
 agent right now, then you shouldn't
 bother loading it. And we have a layered
 approach to help with this. And so we
 start with our global rules. These are
 our constraints and conventions that we
 always want our coding agent to be aware
 of. And so you want this file to be
 pretty concise. Usually between 500 and
 700 lines long is what I go for. A lot
 of people advocate for even less. But
 you have things like your architecture,
 the commands to run, things like your
 testing and logging strategy. This is my
 example from Archon. But these are the
 things that you want your coding agent
 to be aware of all of the time. And then
 we have our layer 2. So our ondemand
 context as I call it. These are rules
 that apply only to specific parts of the
 codebase. Like if we're working on the
 front end, which you aren't always, but
 if you are, here are the global rules
 for the front end or here are the global
 rules for building API endpoints. So we
 add this onto our global rules for
 specific task types because we aren't
 always going to be working on the front
 end. For example, to show you one
 example of this, we have the workflow
 YAML reference that I pulled just a
 little bit ago with the explorer sub
 agent. So when we are working on the
 workflows, then we care about this, but
 we don't want this in our global rules
 because most of the time when we're
 working on archon, we're not actually
 working on this specific part of the
 codebase. And so it's on demand context.
 Then the third layer that we have here
 is skills. This is very popular with
 cloud code and beyond. Right now we have
 the different stages here where the
 agent is going to explore the
 instructions and capabilities in the
 skill as it deems that it actually needs
 it. So we start with the description.
 This is a very small amount of tokens
 loaded in up front with our global
 rules. If the agent decides it wants to
 use this skill, then it'll load the full
 skill.md which can also point to other
 scripts or reference documents that we'd
 want to load. if we're going even deeper
 into the skill. And so as an example of
 that, I have my agent browser skill.
 This is what I use for my browser
 automation for all my endto-end testing
 I was showing earlier. I use this every
 single day. And so whenever I am doing
 my end toend testing, then I want to
 load this instruction set so the agent
 understands how to use the agent
 browser. And then finally for the fourth
 layer here, I have prime commands. So
 everything else I've covered here is
 static documentation that we're going to
 update every once in a while. But
 sometimes we need our agent to do
 exploration of our live codebase. We
 need to make sure that all of its
 information is completely up to date and
 we're willing to spend some tokens with
 sub agents up front making that happen.
 That's what the prime command does is we
 are exploring our codebase at the start
 of our planning process. So it
 understands our codebase going into what
 we want to build next. And as you can
 see in my commands folder, I have many
 different prime commands because there
 are different parts of the codebase I
 want the agent to understand depending
 on what I want to build. And so my
 generic prime command is this one we're
 looking at right here. I just tell it to
 get an understanding of the archon
 codebase at a high level. And so step by
 step here is what I want it to read
 through including the git log because
 that is important for using our git log
 as longterm memory. I also have a
 specialized one, prime workflows, for
 when I know that I'm working on the
 workflow engine in Archon. So, a very
 similar command, but just more
 specialized. So, I use this at the start
 of the conversation so that my agent can
 quickly load everything it needs. I can
 confirm it understands my codebase.
 Then, I get into the planning process
 that I was showing you earlier. So, as a
 super quick summary, global rules are
 always loaded on demand context when you
 know you're about to work on a part of a
 codebase that is documented separately.
 skills when you need different
 capabilities like okay it's time to do
 endto-end testing let's load the skill
 for the agent browser and then prime
 commands I will usually run at the very
 start of a conversation to set the stage
 for my planning so that is everything
 for select now we will go to compress
 and this is actually the fastest section
 to cover because you shouldn't need to
 compress often if you're doing the right
 isolate and select well if we are doing
 all the other strategies to keep our
 context lean we are avoiding this and
 this is good because you want to avoid
 compressing as much as possible. If you
 must compress then there are a couple of
 strategies to cover here and those two
 strategies are the handoff and a focus
 compaction. So let's get into cloud code
 and take a look at this. So the handoff
 we already covered. It's one of our
 write strategies. We summarize
 everything that we just did to hand off
 to another agent or the same agent after
 memory compaction. And then we have the
 built-in compact command in claude code.
 This is going to summarize our
 conversation, then wipe the conversation
 and put the summary at the top of our
 context window. Now, the handoff is
 really powerful because that's where we
 get to define our own workflow for how
 we remember information. But the
 slashcompact is very useful as well,
 especially because we can optionally
 provide summarization instructions. When
 I absolutely have to compact, I will use
 this every single time. for example,
 focus on the edge cases that we just
 tested. Right? So now it's going to when
 it creates that summary pay more
 attention to that part of its shortterm
 memory. I didn't spell it right. That's
 totally good. It'll run the compaction
 here. And so the handoff and
 slashcompact are kind of either or. But
 I definitely find times where I want to
 use both. The handoff, especially when
 you run into a compaction more than
 twice. Usually that conversation is
 getting way too bloated. So you want to
 start a fresh session with the handoff.
 But if I'm just doing it once, a lot of
 times I am okay running a slashcompact
 once. But usually after a compact, I
 will still ask the agent to summarize
 what it remembers so I can make sure
 that it truly understands, right? Like
 what do you remember here? Something
 like that. And so yeah, it really isn't
 ideal. Avoid compaction as much as
 possible. The best compression strategy
 is not needing compression. All right.
 So that is the whisk framework. I know
 it was a lot. So, I hope that you found
 this helpful. And let me know if there's
 any one strategy that you want me to
 dive into deeper cuz I could make an
 entire video on any one of these
 strategies. But this is the Whisk
 framework. I hope that you can use this
 to take you to the next level of cloud
 code or really any AI coding assistant.
 And so if you found this video helpful
